# Black Friday Sales Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze Black Friday sales data using Python. The dataset used for this analysis contains information about various products sold during Black Friday sales, including their categories, prices, purchase amounts, demographics of buyers, etc.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project i.e `BlackFriday.csv`, contains the raw data for Black Friday sales.

## Requirements

To run the analysis scripts, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your machine along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

## Analysis

The analysis is performed in the `Black Friday Sales Analysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. It includes the following steps:

1. Data Loading and Inspection: Loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and performing initial exploration.
2. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, data type conversions, and any inconsistencies in the data.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to gain insights into various aspects of Black Friday sales such as popular products, sales trends, customer demographics, etc.
4. Statistical Analysis: Conducting statistical tests and analyses to explore relationships and patterns in the data.
5. Conclusion: Summarizing the findings and insights obtained from the analysis.

## Usage
